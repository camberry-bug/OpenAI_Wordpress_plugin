# OpenAI_Wordpress_plugin

# GOAL: Create a wordpress plugin that allows the user on a wordpress website to be able to type something into a search-like box, and the question will be sent to the openAI api to retreive and display a response

Ultimate goal is that I can control the type of the prompt that is sent to openAI and what the ser enters is just a small token/peice that gets added somewhere in the prompt that I really want to send out to openAI
